Function for reading Hookie AM 20 accelerometer data from the .DAT -file
produced by the accelerometer. I got the specification from Jouni
Lunnasmaa of Traxmeet Ltd (the manufacturer of the accelerometer) and the
specification is available through their webpage http://www.hookiemeter.com/support

The function returns values as 16 bit integers and you need to apply
the appropriate scaling if you wish to have the g values. From AM20
with a range of +-16 g the scaling is 32/(2^13), where 32 is the full
range in g and 2^13 is the number of discretization levels (i.e. the 
A/D conversion is 13 bit, while the data is saved as 16 bit integers).

Also, the accelerometer may (and will) go into energy saving mode, which
causes incontinuities within the data. Use the timestmaps to figure out
where the accelerations have been below the inactivity threshold and
fill in appropriate values (e.g. the last recorded value) to create
contiuous data.
